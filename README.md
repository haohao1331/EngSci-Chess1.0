# EngSci-Chess1.0
A self-designed 3D chess game made using Unity. The main innovative feature of this chess game is that it uses a 3D cube as the chessboard,
rather than the conventional 2D chessboards. By adding a whole new dimention, the game complexity and imagination required by the player 
increases drastically, creating brand new ways of thinking and new game rules that adopt the extra dimention.
